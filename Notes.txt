NOTES:
-I had difficulties with setting up my Facebook application. I was not able to assign all needed permissions to my application.
 My Facebook application has no permission to work with user's liked pages.
-Because of these difficulties I did not implement endpoint GET /users/{userFbId}/likes.
-Application also does not work with profile picture URL's. 
-All other functionality and endpoints are implemented as it is defined in assignment.
